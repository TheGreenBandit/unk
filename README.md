Unk.
The most advancely designed modmenu for the game REPO. 
Made by TGB with some contributions from others

# Using
The most simple way to use is to use my [loader](https://github.com/thegreenbandit/loader/releases)
which auto updates itself.

If you prefer just using the dll however you can download the latest from [releases](https://thegreenbandit/unk/releases)
Using [SMI](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases) 

Paste the following into command prompt with all the smi stuff in the same folder as the dll
```
smi.exe inject -a Unk.dll -n Unk -c Loader -m Init
```
